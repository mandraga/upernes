
Sprite zero emulation:

Sprite 0 is used to detect the position of a line being drawn, in theory when a non transparent background pixel
is overlaping a non transparent pixel of the sprite it sets bit 6 to one in PPUSTATUS.

; $2002 | R   | PPU Status Register
;       | 0-5 | Unknown (???)
;       |   6 | Hit Flag, 1 = Sprite refresh has hit sprite #0.
;       |     | This flag resets to 0 when screen refresh starts
;       |     | (see "PPU Details").

This is used in super mario to sync with the end of Vblank.
And therefore it must at least do this, it could be done with an HDMA channel.

Upernes uses the Vertical counter irq to set a flag on the sprite top line, regardless of the background.
It can be used to set and reset the value.
And when a read to the PPUSTATUS is performed it will return the bit from the emulation variable in his sprite 0
flag bit. It will be precise at least on Y.

The other solution is to latch the current Horizontal/Verticla counters and set the value of the flag to 1
if Y >= V and X >= V. It will have more precision and not mess with interrupts and won't be a state machine.

Super mario NMI writes to registers, then waits for Vblank using sprite Zero flag and then executes the state machine code.
